#### Examples:

The `<SearchResultsCount>` component only functions inside a `<SearchResults>` component in an active search, so it'snot possible to include a live example here. For a more example of its usage, please look at the source code for the SearchPage.

```jsx
  const { Searcher } = require('../../src/components/Searcher');
  <Searcher>
    <SearchResultsCount />
  </Searcher>
```
